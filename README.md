# WeatherWide
Simple Weather App for Android which displays 14 days and current day hourly forecast.

This app uses Weather Data provided by weatherapi.com. I used free version of api so this app will show 3 days or forecast only.

If you want to get 14 day forecast, You will have to create an account from weatherapi.com and obtain paid or trial key for your self.

This app is made using XML and Java only and it Uses AsynTaskLoaders to retrieve data in JSON format from webapi. The icons are also provided by webapi.

Here is little demo:
